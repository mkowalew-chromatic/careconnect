### Major Changes

- 218f442: Consolidated the standalone Billing app into the EHR app as a role-gated `/billing` section, and added role-based access control to billing.

  - Added a new `Billing` role. Billing access is now enforced both on the API (`Administrator`/`Billing` get full view/edit/delete, `Manager` gets view-only, all other roles get no access) and in the EHR UI (nav item, routes, and write controls are hidden for users without access).
  - Previously, every billing API route only required being logged in — any authenticated user of any role could view or modify billing data. That gap is now closed.
  - The standalone `apps/billing` app, its dev port (4002), and its separate deployment (nginx server blocks, build step) have been removed. Billing now lives at `/billing` inside the EHR app.
  - Added demo accounts `billing@se-tools.net` (Billing role) and `manager@se-tools.net` (Manager role) to exercise the new access tiers.
