# @careconnect/design-system-native

CareConnect's React Native components: the native counterpart of [`@careconnect/design-system`](../design-system). Owned by the Design system team; release unit `design-system-native`.

It is consumed as TypeScript source by [`apps/portal-mobile`](../../apps/portal-mobile), at HEAD, like the web library is by the web apps. A breaking change fails that app's typecheck or bundle on the same pull request. The stories here are built into the mobile app's Storybook and captured by Chromatic on iOS and Android; there is no separate Storybook host.

## Tokens

[`src/tokens/tokens.ts`](src/tokens/tokens.ts) mirrors the web `src/styles/tokens.css`, which stays the source of truth. Colors are copied as-is, rem values are converted at 16px, and the CSS shadows become `shadow*`/`elevation` props. `tokens.test.ts` parses `tokens.css` and fails if any value or key differs, so a token change has to land in both places.

## Components

`Text`, `Button`, `Badge` (with `appointmentStatusBadge` / `formatStatusLabel`), `Card`, `TextField`, `ChipGroup`, `OptionCard`, `ListRow`, `StatCard`, `Avatar`, `Alert`, `EmptyState`, `Spinner`, `LoadingState`, `StepProgress`, `SlotPicker`, `MessageBubble`, `Screen`. [`src/index.ts`](src/index.ts) is the authoritative list.

They are shaped for touch and small screens, not ported one-to-one from the web library. For example, `SlotPicker` (a day strip plus a time grid) stands in for the web `ScheduleCalendar`, and `ListRow` stands in for tables.

## Motion

Animated components read `useMotion()`. It returns `false` under `<MotionProvider animate={false}>` or when the OS **Reduce Motion** setting is on, and the component then renders a fixed frame. Storybook sets this for Chromatic captures, so animated states are snapshotted deterministically rather than excluded. Follow the same pattern for any new animation.

## Conventions

- One folder per component with its `*.stories.tsx` next to it. Story titles get the `Design System/` prefix from the app's Storybook config.
- Pure logic (no `react-native` import) goes in its own module with a `*.test.ts` (`npm test` runs these under Node). Components are exercised through stories.
- Accessibility: set `accessibilityRole`/`accessibilityState` on interactive elements and keep touch targets at 44pt or more.
